Jackle is a tiny and _experimental_ framework for building `redux-like` web applications. It exposes a small API for managing components, state changes, routing and more!

## Getting Started

Install with yarn or npm​

```bash
yarn add jackle
```

Import and start using

```ts
import { Jackle } from 'jackle';
​
const jackle = new Jackle();
jackle.parser([...]);
jackle.handler([...]);
jackle.component([...]);
jackle.route([...]);
```

## API

Additional documentation and guides can be found in [the github wiki](https://github.com/8eecf0d2/jackle/wiki).

### Overview

In Jackle there are a few core modules, the **Parser**, **Handler**, **Component** and **Route**, all modules follow a simple `Object` structure allow for a lot of flexiblity in regards to how they're composed.

If you get lost or are confused about how Jackle works it's _highly_ recommended to read the source, Jackle is _less than 200 lines_ of _verbose_ and _commented_ code.

### `jackle.parser(parser: Jackle.parser|Jackle.parser[])`

A **Parser** is similar to an `Action` in redux, it's used to format input and which can be used by a `handler`.

The example below get's the value of an `input` element.

```ts
export const update_temp_parser: Jackle.parser = {
  name: 'update:temp',
  parser: (input: HTMLInputElement) => {
    return input.value;
  }
}
jackle.parser(update_temp_parser);
```

### `jackle.handler(handler: Jackle.handler|Jackle.handler[])`

A **Handler** is similar to a `Reducer` in redux, it's purpose is to change the `state` of the application, it recieves data from a `parser` and decides what needs to change in the `state`.

The example below recieves the return value from the `parser` above, and returns a modified state.

```ts
export const update_temp_handler: Jackle.handler = {
  name: 'update:temp',
  handlers: [
    (state: State, text: string) => {
      state.temp = {
        text: text
      }
      return state;
    }
  ]
}
jackle.handler(update_temp_handler);
```

Handlers are `async` and you can provide an array of functions to simplify duties, each handler **must** return a state object.

The example below first checks that the `text` argument is at least _10 characters long_, before continuing and modifying the state.

If you throw an error the chain will stop.

```ts
export const update_temp_handler: Jackle.handler = {
  name: 'update:temp',
  handlers: [
    (state, text: string) => {
      if(text.length < 10) {
        throw new Error('Text must be at least 10 characters long')
      }
      return state;
    },
    (state, text: string) => {
      state.temp = {
        text: text
      }
      return state;
    }
  ]
}
jackle.handler(update_temp_handler);
```

### `jackle.change(name: string, data: any)`

The `change` method in Jackle is similar to `Dispatch` in redux, it's used to change the state - you can access it directly from a `Jackle` instance or from `state.change()`.

If you call the `change` method and a `handler` throws an error, the error will bubble to the caller - so be ready to catch them.

The example below calls the `update:temp` example from above.

```ts
jackle.change('update:temp', document.querySelector('input'));
// this calls the update:temp parser
// which then calls the update:temp handler
```

### `jackle.component(component: Jackle.component|Jackle.component[])`

Components are a used to create html, you provide a `selector` value which will be used to bind to a matching element (`document.querySelector(selector)`).

The Component `template` property will be called **every** time the state changes, the `template` property can be async and will have three arguments, `state`, `html` and `controller`.

The `state` argument is a frozen (`Object.freeze()`) copy of the state, this is because all changes to the state should be performed by calling the `change` method.
The `html` argument is a `hyperhtml.BoundTemplateFunction<HTMLElement>` function, which is more or less a component literal tagging function.
The `controller` argument will only be provided if there was a `controller` defined for the component.

The example below will use `document.querySelector()` to find an element matching `#form` and then output the tagged component literal to the DOM.

```ts
export const form_component: Jackle.component = {
  selector: '#form',
  template: async (state, html) => {
    html`
      <form>
        <input type="text" value=${state.temp.text}>
      </form>
    `;
  }
}
```

```html
<body>
  <div id="form">
    <!-- <form> element will be placed here -->
  </div>
</body>
```

That example is pretty straight forward, to take it further we can bind the `input` element's value with the state, to do this we could `change('update:temp')` when the `input` element value changes.
Fortunately `input` elements have `onchange` and `oninput` events, we can use them to call `state.change`;

```ts
export const form_component: Jackle.component = {
  selector: '#form',
  template: async (state, html) => {
    html`
      <form>
        <input type="text" oninput=${(e: any) => state.change('update:temp', e.target)} value=${state.temp.text}>
      </form>
    `;
  }
}
```

However this method of writing long lambdas within element attributes can get hard to read pretty quickly, so the next logical solution is to also write a simple `controller` for handling interactions.

```ts
export const form_component: Jackle.component = {
  selector: '#form',
  controller: (state) => {
    return {
      oninput: (event: any) => {
        state.change('update:temp', event.target);
      }
    }
  },
  template: async (state, html, controller) => {
    html`
      <form>
        <input type="text" oninput=${controller.oninput} value=${state.temp.text}>
      </form>
    `;
  }
}
```

Personally I'm a fan of keeping file counts to a minimum but since **Components** are simple objects you can split them up into separate files and change the structure to suit your needs.

You can also take the idea of components _much_ further by also mixing in [hyperHTML components](https://viperhtml.js.org/hyperhtml/documentation/#components).
